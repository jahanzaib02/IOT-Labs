Activity 1:
It requires a bit map image to display emoji on oled. 
The values of humidiy changed immediately as i blew on the sensor.
Activity 2:
Without interrupt the oled continues to show humidity and temperature value which can cause loss of electricity when we have limited resources.
When we want that it only display values when i click a button (interrupt) we need interrupts to handle such situations.
After applying interrupt the values only displayed when we caused interrupt through the button and disappeared again on the second interrupt.
